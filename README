What this Program Does: 
-----------------------
	
	This program is to simulate scheduling as it is done inside
	and operating system. The operating system simulator (OSS)
	will generate child processes (USERS) for 3 seconds or up to 
	100, not to exceed 18 concurrent USER programs. The OSS will 
	then add USERS to a round-robin run queue and simulate each
	USER getting CPU time with a quantum of 10 ms. The OSS and 
	USER communicate using messages. When a USER is dispatched 
	to the CPU it will simulate running and generate 1 of 3 
	conditions, Ready, Blocked, or Terminate. If the USER returns 
	Ready it has run for its entire quantum and it is put back 
	onto the run queue by the OSS. If USER returns Blocked it will 
	randomly select a time from 20%-100% of its quantum it ran and 
	return the remaining to the OSS, it will also report how long 
	it should be blocked and reporots to the OSS. The OSS will then 
	put it into a blocked queue and wake it when its time has passed. 
	Third condition is if USER returns Terminate. When this event 
	happens USER will generate a time from 20%-100% of its quantum 
	then return the rest to OSS. Its statistics are added to a 
	global struct to document USER behaviors, the USER dies, OSS
	removes this process from the run queue and clears it from 
	the bit vector. 

	After all USERS have stopped being produced, all active USERS
	will continue to run until they terminate. Once all USERS 
	terminate, memory resources are cleaned up, a report is generated
	and a logfile has been populated for reviewing OSS processes.

===============================================================

How to Use this Program: 
------------------------

	1) Execute Makefile
		
		$ make

	2) Execute oss prgram
		
		$ ./oss [-h][-s t][-l f]

	USAGE: 

		-h         Displays Help/Usage
		-s t       Time in seconds before program terminates
		-l f       Specifies the name for generated logfile

===============================================================
===============================================================

Observations about this Program: 
--------------------------------

	An interesting observation I had during this project.
	Is that this OSS is running ontop of an actual Operating 
	System, so special considerations had to be added to ensure
	this program actually behaved well when being executed by 
	the CPU on the hoare server. Because the CPU time on hoare
	is divided between all my processes there was times when 
	my OSS would create a USER, add it to its run queue, pop it,
	and send it a message to allocate it simulated CPU time. But
	because of how actual CPU time is allocated the USER process 
	would occasionly still be initializing its parameters and 
	would not be waiting for its message yet. This would cause a
	an error. I solved this by adding another message queue into 
	the spawn USER process. Once a USER is spawned the OSS will not
	continue until it recieves a message from the USER that it has
	been initialized and is ready to recieve messages.
